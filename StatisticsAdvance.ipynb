    "    The z-statistic, also known as the z-score, is a measure that describes the position of a data point relative to the mean of a dataset,\n",
    "    expressed in terms of standard deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The z-statistic for a sample mean is given by the formula:\n",
    "    z = (sample mean) - (population mean) / standard error of the mean \n",
    "    where, standard error of the mean = population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    While dealing with a single data point, the z-score would be: \n",
    "    z = (individual data point x) - mean of the population / standard deviation of the population.\n",

    "    Relationship to the Standard Normal Distribution:\n",
    "    The z-statistic is directly related to the standard normal distribution (also known as the Z-distribution), which has:\n",
    "    mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "    A z-statistic indicates how many standard deviations a particular value is from the mean. Positive z-values indicate values above the mean,\n",

    "    4. Result of the CLT: According to the CLT, the distribution of these sample means will approximate a normal distribution with:\n",
